            <p>Hello, My name is Cierra Peters. I live in the Philippines but was born and raised in Utah. My small family (my husband and four year old son) and I live in the Philippines because of my husband's job which is building LDS temples. We will be moving soon from Alabang down to Davao to help finish the temple down there. I love riding my bike (mostly becuase I hate driving). I use it for everything such as taking my son to school, getting food, taking the dog to the vet, everything.</p>

            <p>I live in the Philippines on the southern island known as Mindanao, this region has been called "unsafe" for many years because of wars and terrorism groups which means that the beauty of this amazing island area hasn't been seen by many outsiders.</p>
